;;; Commentary:

;; This file is symlinked by "~/.config/guile-daemon/init.scm".

;;; Code:

(use-modules
 (daemon defaults)              ; for %default-config-file
 (al utils))                    ; for push!

;; FIXME Is it possible to get the full name of this file (init.scm)
;; while it is loaded (analog of `load-file-name' in Emacs)?  This would
;; allow to define "modules" directory even if guile-daemon is started
;; with non-standard config file.
(let* ((init.scm (canonicalize-path %default-config-file))
       (modules  (string-append (dirname init.scm)
                                "/modules")))
  (push! modules %load-path))

(set-current-module (resolve-module '(daemon-config)))

;; init.scm ends here
